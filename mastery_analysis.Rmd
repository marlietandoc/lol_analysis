## The data
Mastery data from 14343 different summoners from Iron to Diamond. For each summoner,  I took their top 3 champions (three champions with the most mastery points) as their three mains. I then looked at how often certain champions co-occured (were correlated) in mains across players.

## The big picture
I first wanted to eyeball every champions relationship to all other champions as a giant correlation matrix (heatmap) just to see if there is any meaningful relationships at all in what champions are often mained by the same players. This checkerboard visual is showing every pairwise relationship between all champions. A blue square means those two champions (line up the champ name on the vertical and horizontal axis) are often mained together. A red squares means those two champions are rarely mained together. I ordered the champions using hierarchical clustering which creates these "groups" of champions based on their similarity (how often they are mained together across players) to other champions which creates several large blue clusters. For example, in the very bottom left you can see an assassin cluster emerging where if you play one assassin you are likely to play another. I know it's hard to see so let's zoom in a bit. 
```{r matrix, echo = FALSE,fig.height = 30, fig.width = 30, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

#Read in mastery data pulled from Riot API
setwd("~/Documents/GitHub/lol/lol_analysis/mastery_data")
mastery_files <- list.files(recursive=TRUE, pattern = "*mastery")
mastery  <- do.call(rbind.fill,lapply(mastery_files,read.csv))

#mastery <- read.csv('all_mastery.csv')

#Number of unique summoners
#length(unique(mastery$summonerId))

## For each summoner find their top 3 mains (based on mastery points)
mains <- mastery %>%
  group_by(summonerId) %>%
  summarize(main_1 = name[1],
            main_2 = name[2],
            main_3 = name[3]) %>%
  drop_na()

#Turn into one hot vector/dummy coding to compute correlation matrix
mains_melted <- dcast(melt(mains,id.var="summonerId"), summonerId ~ value, length) %>% select(-summonerId)

#Compute correlation matrix
cor <- cor(mains_melted)
#Melt mains into a one-hot vector matrix/dummy coding
melted_cormat <- melt(cor)
filtered_melted_cormat <- melted_cormat %>%
  drop_na()

#Order based on a hiearchical clustering algorithm based on the dissimilarities from the correlation matrix
clust <- hclust(dist(t(cor)))

#Graph
ggplot(data = filtered_melted_cormat, aes(x=as.character(Var1),  y= as.character(Var2), fill=value)) + 
  geom_tile()+
  scale_fill_gradient2(low = "red", high = "blue", mid = "white", 
                       midpoint = 0, limit = c(-0.1,0.21), space = "Lab", 
                       name="Correlation") + 
  dark_theme_gray(base_size = 20,base_family = 'Helvetica') + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, vjust = 1, hjust = 1))+
  scale_y_discrete(limits = colnames(cor)[clust$order])+
  scale_x_discrete(limits = colnames(cor)[clust$order]) +
  labs(y = '', x = '') +
  #ggtitle('What mains are tightly correlated?')+ 
  theme(plot.background = element_rect(fill = '#171717', colour = '#171717'))


```

Upon zooming in, we can see a support-like, mage cluster and an assassin-like cluster forming (blue clusters). This shows how players that play mage/support champs also play many similar champions, but less often play assassins (red colors indicate negative correlation) 

```{r zoom_in_matrix, echo = FALSE,fig.height = 30, fig.width = 30, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics(paste0(getwd(), "/graphics/rsa_zoom_in.png"))



```



## Most mastered
Champions with the most mastery points (most popular)
```{r most_mastered, echo = FALSE,fig.height = 30, fig.width = 30, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

#What champions have highest mastery (yasuo seems like)
most_mastered <- mastery %>%
  group_by(name) %>%
  summarize(mean_points = mean(championPoints)) %>%
  arrange(desc(mean_points))

head(most_mastered)

```




## Most related champions
These are the champion pairs that are the most correlated with one another (most commonly mained together). For example, if you main Yasuo you are likely to play Zed.
```{r most_related, echo = FALSE,fig.height = 30, fig.width = 30, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

#List of champions that are most related
how_related <- filtered_melted_cormat %>%
  filter(value < 1) %>%
  arrange(desc(value))
how_related <- how_related[!duplicated(how_related$value),]

#Most related (value = if you main this champion, how correlated they are across players, 1 = if champions main this champ 100% of the  time they main this other champ, -1 = if champions main this champ 0% of the time they main this other champ)
most_related <- head(how_related, 5)

most_related
# # 
# # #Read in images
#  setwd("/Users/tandoc/Documents/GitHub/lol/lol_analysis/champs_squares")
# # 
# # #Loop through most related list and create side by side images of champion icons
# for (i in 1:nrow(most_related)) {
# 
#   c1 <- image_read(paste(most_related$Var1[i],'Square.png', sep = ''))
#    c2 <- image_read(paste(most_related$Var2[i],'Square.png', sep = ''))
# 
# 
#   if (i ==1 ) {
#   #Initialize final image
#   final_image <- image_border(image_append(c(c1,c2)),color = 'lightblue')
# 
#   } else {
# 
#    pair <-image_border(image_append(c(c1,c2)),color = 'lightblue')
# 
#    #Append to final image
#    final_image <- c(final_image, pair)
# 
#   }
# 
# }
# 
#    last_image <- image_append(final_image, stack = TRUE)
#   
#   #Save to results directory as workaround for embedding issue with magick package
#   setwd("/Users/tandoc/Documents/GitHub/lol/lol_analysis/graphics")
#   image_write(last_image, path = paste('most_related', '.png', sep = ''), format = "png")
  
 # knitr::include_graphics(path.expand("most_related.png"))
  knitr::include_graphics(paste0(getwd(), "/graphics/most_related.png"))
  
  
```




## Least related champions
These are the champion pairs that are the least correlated (most infrequently mained together). That is if you main Yasuo you are least likely to also main Lux. Yasuo mains seem to have very strong preferences of what other champs they tend to play and not play!
```{r least_related, echo=FALSE, fig.height=30, fig.width=30, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

#Least related
least_related <- tail(how_related, 5) %>%
  arrange(value)

least_related

# #Read in images
# setwd("/Users/tandoc/Documents/GitHub/lol/lol_analysis/champs_squares")
# 
# #Loop through least related list and create side by side images of champion icons
# for (i in 1:nrow(least_related)) {
# 
#   c1 <- image_read(paste(least_related$Var1[i],'Square.png', sep = ''))
#    c2 <- image_read(paste(least_related$Var2[i],'Square.png', sep = ''))
# 
# 
#   if (i ==1 ) {
#   #Initialize final image
#   final_image <- image_border(image_append(c(c1,c2)),color = '#f7bfbc')
# 
#   } else {
# 
#    pair <-image_border(image_append(c(c1,c2)),color = '#f7bfbc')
# 
#    #Append to final image
#    final_image <- c(final_image, pair)
# 
#   }
# 
# }
# 
#     last_image <- image_append(final_image, stack = TRUE)
#   
#   #Save to results directory as workaround for embedding issue with magick package
#   setwd("/Users/tandoc/Documents/GitHub/lol/lol_analysis/graphics")
#   image_write(last_image, path = paste('least_related', '.png', sep = ''), format = "png")

knitr::include_graphics(paste0(getwd(), "/graphics/least_related.png"))
  


```


## If you main X champion..
I wrote a function where you input a champion's name and it spits out the top 3 champs players most often and least often mained with that champion. Using the results from this, I made a graphic (photoshop) of 8 example champions and their most likely and least likely mains.

```{r func_play, echo=FALSE, fig.height=30, fig.width=30, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

#Function spits out a dataframe of the most correlated and least correlated champions.
#champ_num = Champion name as a string (case sensitive)
#other_num = The number of other champions you want (e.g.) 3 = top 3 most correlated and least correlated)
calc_if_you_play <- function(champ_name, other_num) {
  
  sorted <- filter(filtered_melted_cormat, Var1 == champ_name) %>%
    arrange(desc(value)) %>%
    filter(value < 1) #Exclude champion with itself
  
  most_mained_together <- head(as.character(sorted$Var2), other_num) 
  
  least_mained_together <- rev(tail(as.character(sorted$Var2), other_num))
  
  
  df <- data.frame(most_mained_together, least_mained_together)
  print(champ_name)
  df
  
}

#Example
calc_if_you_play('Teemo', 3)



knitr::include_graphics(paste0(getwd(), "/graphics/mains.png"))




```





## Network visualization
Another way to visualize this data is as a network. I visualized only champions that had strong connections with other champions (were often mained together). Connections (white lines) indicate a strong relationship in how often champions are mained together across players. Because the network is force-directed, the distance between the nodes (cricles) indicate how often those champions are mained together. You can see communities that naturally emerge that seem to reflect champion playstyles (assassins cluster, support cluster, etc.). You can also see some neat connections between these communities such as the champions with pulls (Thresh/Blitz/Pyke) being frequently mained together. But with Pyke having more direct connections with the assassin cluster.

```{r network, echo=FALSE, fig.height=10, fig.width=10, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

#To simplify the network, for each player I choose their Top 2 most mastered champions
simple_mains <- select(mains, main_1,main_2) %>%
  filter(!(is.na(main_1)), !(is.na(main_2)))

#Creates an edge list of all connections between every champion
#The weight column is simply the number of times a pair of champions is observed as mained together
edges <- simple_mains %>%
  group_by(main_1,main_2) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(weight = n()) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  filter(weight > 11) #Only visualize stronger connections for visual clarity

#Creates dataframes compatible with igraph for visualization
edge_df= edges %>%
  mutate(type = 'undirected')
graph = graph_from_data_frame(d=edge_df,directed = FALSE)


#Prepares champion icons to be used in the graph
graph_champs <- V(graph)$name
img_list <- list() 
for (i in 1:length(graph_champs)) {
  c <- graph_champs[i]
  img <- readPNG(paste("./champs_cropped/crop_", c,'.png', sep =''))
  img_list[i] <- list(img)
}

#Add images to network object
V(graph)$raster <- img_list

#VIsualize network with curved connections
par(bg = '#171717')
plot(graph, vertex.shape="raster", vertex.label=NA,
     vertex.size=14,vertex.size2=14, edge.width=1,layout=layout_with_fr,
     edge.curved=0.2, edge.color = 'white')




```
